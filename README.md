## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tim, a self taught developer and lifelong learner who loves to explore new technologies and build products that help real people. 

### About Me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently the chair of The Climbing Clan and The Caving Crew, BMC and BCA affiliated climbing and caving clubs that I founded. Through my work with these clubs, I've developed several software products to assist with club operations. Most notably, I've created **neoClan**, a second-generation membership check-in system.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently teaching myself React with the Mantine framework and Next.js, as well as exploring react-query and advanced git workflows.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m keen on opportunities for freelance work and development. If you have an exciting project, I'd love to collaborate!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Linux administration and rock climbing and caving.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: github at my github user name dot net
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a wonderful son called James.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch if youâ€™d like to work together or just chat about tech and climbing.
